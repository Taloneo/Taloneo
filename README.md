# Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

Hello! I'm Leonardo, an Italo-Argentinian Bachelor of Electronic Arts with expertise at the intersection of art and technology. I specialize in crafting innovative projects that blend programming, mechatronics, and applied electronics. My focus is on building amazing things, from code to physical interfaces and interactive devices.

## About Me 🚀

- 🔭 Currently exploring the exciting realm of technology and art, blending creativity with engineering.
- 🌱 My skill set encompasses JavaScript, NODE, MongoDb, Docker, Express, Arduino, Processing, git, HTML, CSS, React.js, Linux, and Windows, among others.
- 🎨 My most significant experience was as a researcher and artistic creator at MUNTREF Art and Science, collaborating in multidisciplinary teams with engineers, artists, creators, and scientists.
- 💻 I enjoy creating efficient and elegant solutions for technological and artistic challenges.

## Featured Projects 🛠️

### [Quorum Sensing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370476208_Quorum_Sensing_y_Vajilla_Emocional)
"Quorum Sensing" is a gastrosophonic experience for three diners. A soup is served in a special glass tableware (Emotional Tableware), designed as a result of a research project on associations of shapes and materials with musical emotions. The actions of each diner generate vibrations applied to the bodies of the others. I participated in the design, prototyping, construction, and programming of the devices used in the work using Arduino, Node, MQTT, and as the author of the scientific article on which the work was based.
Presented at Turku University. 


### [Aroma Organ]

The Aroma Organ is a device I designed and built, consisting of 12 towers equipped with WiFi-enabled microcontrollers. These microcontrollers are programmed to activate various aromas in response to MIDI input from a keyboard while a musician performs. The entire system is orchestrated using Arduino, the UDP protocol, OSC and JavaScript.

I where able to create a unique sensory experience by linking the world of music to the olfactory senses. Each tower releases a distinct fragrance in sync with the melodies produced by the musician. The result is a interesting fusion of sound and scent.
